# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Types of Variables

### Categorical

#### nominal

- discrete units
- no order i.e. changing the order does not change the meaning (male, female === female, male)

**Summarize/analyse by**:

- Frequencies (count each one)
- Proportion (relative freq) or percentage
- Vis: Bar, Pie

#### Ordinal

- discrete units
- order matters
- distance between units is not same (1st, 2nd and 3rd place in race)

**Summarize/analyse by**:

- Frequencies, proportions etc.
- percentiles (xth percentile)
- mode, median, IQ range
- vis: bar, pie

### Continuous

#### interval

- ordered units of the same size
- distance between units is the same
- e.g. test scales
- no absolute zero

#### ratio

- same as interval (ordered, same distance), but has _absoulte 0_
- 12inch is double 6inch

**Summarize/analyse (for both types) by**:

- percentiles, iq range, mean, median and mode, stddiv, range, IQR
- Vis: histogram, boxplot

## Visualisations

### box plot

- Good to identify outliers/extreme values
- good for central tendancy, skewness and variability
- can't do number of modes
- consider including min, max mean and SD in the vis

#### side-by-side box plot

- visualise relationshup between 1 continuous and one categorical

### histogram

- good view of shape of dist, central tendency, variabilities
- good to identify multiple modes
- bad for outliers
- consider including min, max mean and SD in the vis

### Scatter plot

- relationship between 2 continuos variables

## General tips

- do all the visualisations, but ultimately choose the one that tells the best story
