# Stanford Seminar - NVIDIA GPU Computing: A Journey from PC Gaming to Deep Learning

Source video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98Xis1W1mMk)

## 10:00

- Purpose of GPU - to accelerate computationally-intensive applications

- first gpu's were a collection of "task runners" that performed a number of computationally-expensive things independently/sequentially
- e.g. independent hardware shading engines

## 14:50

- G80 GPU "beggining of GPU computing"
- unified a lot of the hardware to make better utilisation of hardware resources
- "unified shader"

# 18:15 - gpu vs cpu goals

- latency oriented optim - reduce time per unit of work
- throughput oriented optim - maximise work for unit of time
- CUDA - environment for throughput computing

...
Basically, gets better and better with design innovations
